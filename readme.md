## Html website:
Here, ` Explore-Skills-main (HTML Website) ` is Html Website using following features:
- Pages (`index.html`, `contact.html`, `about.html`, `course.html`, `blog.html`)
- Style used (`style.css`)
- & lastly `script.js` with few Navbar related code.
## Next.js website:
Here, ` explore-skills-main-next_app ` is Next.js Project.\
That will be Updated soon. But Next features used here are:
- TypeScript (No)
- Tailwind (Yes - Not needed)

- `src` Directry (No)

With these settings our app is **Good To GO !**
