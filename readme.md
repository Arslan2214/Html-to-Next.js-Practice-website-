# HTML to NEXT.js Peoject

I had made this project to prectice me skills by converting HTML website to Next.js Project.\
\
**HTML Project** *(Deployed)*:`https://explore-skill-html-project.netlify.app/`

**Next.js Project** *(Deployed)*:`http://explore-skills-next-project.surge.sh`

---
## Html website:
Here, ` Explore-Skills-main (HTML Website) ` is Html Website using following features:
- Pages (`index.html`, `contact.html`, `about.html`, `course.html`, `blog.html`)
- Style used (`style.css`)
- & lastly `script.js` with few Navbar related code.
## Next.js website:
Here, ` explore-skills-main-next_app ` is Next.js Project.\
That will be Updated soon. But Next features used here are:
- TypeScript (No)
- Tailwind (Yes - Not needed)
- App Router (Yes)
- `src` Directry (No)

With these settings our app is **Good To GO !**
Both websites are hosted and ready to checkout performance, But due to variation between different hosting services. There is difference in performace that cannot be judged.
